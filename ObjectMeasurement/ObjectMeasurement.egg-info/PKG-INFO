Description: # Object Measurement
        
        ## Problem Statement
        Given an image, and the dimension(height | width) of an object in the image, measure the dimesnsion of the remaining objects. The object whose dimenstion(s) are known will be our reference object.
        
        ## Methodology
        After we guarantee the reference object, we try and find its contour index. To do this, first install the package using ```pip install ObjectMeasurement``` command on your terminal and follow the code below.
        
        ## Fetched Contour Index Image
        
        The image title shows that, for the reference object, the contour-index is 114. 
        This is displayed as one skims through the images after the ```contours()``` method is invoked.
        
        You need to find this index and pass it as a parameter in ```calc_metrics_pixels()``` method.
        The code for a test case is below.
        
        
        ```python 
        from ObjectMeasurement import obj_measure, midpoint, order_points
        
        # load the image
        path = 'image/image.png'
        image = obj_measure(path)
        
        # draw contour for the outer-boundary if it is required
        image.draw_contour()
        
        # image processing - will help in contour detection
        image.image_processing()
        
        # fetch the contours
        # jot down the index of the contour where you first see the contour of the reference object
        contour = image.contours(min_contour_area=100)
        
        # either the height or the width needs to be known
        height = 0.955 # this was known before-hand
        width = None
        
        # calculate the pixel per metrics
        contour_index = 114 # fetched from the image title
        pixel_per_metric=image.calc_metrics_pixels(contour, contour_index, height=height, width=width)
        
        # displays the measurements of the contours one-by-one
        image.display_measurement(pixel_per_metric, contour, minarea=300)
        ```
